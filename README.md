## WhyBot: An AI Chatbot for Parents with Curious Kids
This project is a portfolio piece demonstrating the creation of WhyBot, an interactive chatbot designed to help parents and caregivers answer a childâ€™s endless "why" questions. The bot provides simple, engaging explanations paired with custom-generated, colorful, realistic illustrations.

## Key Features:

- **Interactive Q&A**: Delivers simple, engaging answers tailored for a young audience.

- **Audio & Voice Input**: Accepts voice commands and provides spoken replies for an interactive experience.

- **AI-Generated Illustrations**: Creates custom, realistic illustrations to accompany each explanation.

- **Safety-First Design**: Implements robust safety features to ensure all content is appropriate and suitable for children.

## Development Process
- **Ideation & Prompt Engineering**: I used the Gemini Brainstorm Gem to conceptualize the app and refined a specific prompt in Google AI Studio to meet the unique requirements of a children's bot.

- **Iterative Development**: I conducted thorough testing and iterative edits on the code and prompts to achieve the desired behavior and accuracy.

- **Advanced Functionality**: Using prompt chaining, I added core features like voice input and audio output to create a more natural user experience.

- **Safety Implementation**: I prioritized and implemented critical safety features to ensure the bot's responses are safe and suitable for a young audience.
